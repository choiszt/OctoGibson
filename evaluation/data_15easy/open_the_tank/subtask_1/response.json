        "explain": " Since there is no previous action code or execution error, we can start planning from scratch. The task goal is to open the tank. The observed objects include a tank, a valve, and a wrench. The wrench is used to interact with the tank, but it is not in the robot's inventory. Therefore, the first step should be to move the robot to the tank and grasp the wrench before attempting to open it.",

In this case, the object is \"bottom_cabinet_no_top_spojpj_0\", which is a cabinet, not a tupperware. The subtask plan is incorrect because it assumes that the tupperware is in the bottom cabinet, but the observed relations do not confirm this. We need to revise the subtasks to first open the cabinet and then grasp the tupperware.",

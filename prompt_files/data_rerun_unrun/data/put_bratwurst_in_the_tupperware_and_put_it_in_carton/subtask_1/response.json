The task goal is to put the bratwurst in the tupperware and then put it in the carton. However, we don't see a tupperware in the observed objects. We can assume that the tupperware might be inside the bottom cabinets as they are often used to store such items. Therefore, the first step would be to open the bottom cabinet to check if the tupperware is inside.",

        "explain": " The error message \"Found zero norm quaternions in `quat`\" indicates that the robot is trying to move to an object that it cannot reach directly. In this case, the robot is trying to move to the stove, which is not directly accessible. The robot can only move to a position in front of large objects (e.g., tables, ovens, etc.) that are placed directly on the ground. The robot cannot directly move to small objects (e.g., apples, plates, etc.). Therefore, we need to revise the subtasks and the action code.",

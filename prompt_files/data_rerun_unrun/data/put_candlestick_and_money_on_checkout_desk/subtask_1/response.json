From the observed relations, we can see that the paraffin wax (which is a component of the candlestick) is inside the grocery shelf and the money is inside the shopping cart. The candle holder (the other component of the candlestick) is on top of the grocery shelf. Therefore, the first step should be to move the robot to the grocery shelf to collect the paraffin wax and the candle holder.",

        "explain": " Since there is no previous action code or execution error, we can start planning from scratch. The task goal is to put an egg in the refrigerator and close it. From the observed objects, we can see that the egg and the fridge are both present in the environment. The fridge is currently closed, and the egg is not heated, freezable, burnable, and cookable. The egg is also more than 2 meters away from the robot, so we need to move the robot closer to the egg before we can interact with it.",

This could be due to the agent trying to interact with an object that is not in its inventory or in its immediate environment. From the observed objects and relations, we can see that the pork chop is already on a plate (plate_191), which is in the agent's inventory. This means that the agent has already completed the task of putting the frozen meat on the plate. However, the meat is not frozen yet, which is why the task goal is not marked as completed. ",

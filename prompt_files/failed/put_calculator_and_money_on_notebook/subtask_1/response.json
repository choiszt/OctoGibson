From the observed relations, we can see that the calculator is inside the grocery_shelf_prtqlw_1, the money is inside the shopping_cart_kmgltg_1, and the notebook is on the grocery_shelf_prtqlw_1. Therefore, the robot needs to first move to the grocery_shelf_prtqlw_1 to get the calculator and the notebook, and then move to the shopping_cart_kmgltg_1 to get the money, and finally put the calculator and money on the notebook.",

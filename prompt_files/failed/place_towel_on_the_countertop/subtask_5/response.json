However, the towel could be inside an object that is not currently opened. The observed relations indicate that there is a bar soap inside the top cabinet, which is currently opened. The towel could be inside the cabinet but hidden by the bar soap. Therefore, the next step should be to take the bar soap out of the cabinet to check if the towel is behind it.",

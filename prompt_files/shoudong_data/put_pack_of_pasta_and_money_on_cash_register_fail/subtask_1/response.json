From the observed objects and relations, we can see that the pack_of_pasta_146 is on the grocery_shelf_prtqlw_0 and the money_148 is inside the shopping_cart_kmgltg_1. The cash_register_142 is on the checkout_counter_sckdal_0. The robot needs to first move to the grocery shelf to get the pack of pasta, then move to the shopping cart to get the money, and finally move to the checkout counter to put these two items on the cash register.",

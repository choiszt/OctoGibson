However, we don't observe a sack in the environment. We do observe a paper bag, which we will assume is the sack referred to in the task goal. The chicken is currently 3.97 meters away from the robot, and the paper bag is 4.35 meters away. The robot needs to move closer to these objects to interact with them.",

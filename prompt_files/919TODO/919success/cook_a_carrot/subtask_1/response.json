The observed objects and relations tell us that the carrot is currently inside the fridge. The fridge is closed as its 'openable' state is 0. The stove is under the saucepot, which means the saucepot is on the stove. The stove is currently off as its 'togglable' state is 0. The first step to cook the carrot is to take it out from the fridge. To do this, we first need to open the fridge.",

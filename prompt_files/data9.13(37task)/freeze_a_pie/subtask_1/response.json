However, we don't have a pie in the observed objects. We do have a cheese tart, which could be considered a type of pie. Therefore, we will assume that the cheese tart is the pie we need to freeze. The cheese tart is currently on a plate. The fridge is currently closed but it is openable. Therefore, the first step would be to open the fridge.",

From the observed objects, we can see that the box_of_cereal_90 is far away from the agent (19.72 meters), and the top_cabinet_dmwxyl_2 is closer (3.22 meters). The cabinet is currently closed. The agent needs to move to the box of cereal, pick it up, move to the cabinet, open the cabinet, and put the box of cereal inside.",

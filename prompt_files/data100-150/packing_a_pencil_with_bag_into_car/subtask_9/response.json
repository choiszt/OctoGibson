However, the task goal is to pack a pencil with a bag into the car. The pencil and bag are not mentioned in the original subtasks. Therefore, the original subtasks are incomplete and need to be revised. The robot should first put the suitcase down, then grasp the pencil, put it into the suitcase, and finally put the suitcase into the car.",

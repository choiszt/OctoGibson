This could be due to the agent trying to interact with an object that is not in its inventory or in its immediate environment. The observed objects and relations indicate that the sack (bap_280) is under the car (car_275), which means the agent needs to move to the car first to access the sack. The original subtasks are correct, but the agent needs to register the car and the sack before it can interact with them.",

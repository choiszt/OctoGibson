From the observed objects and relations, we can see that the colored_pencil_277 is inside the suitcase_276 and both are on the driveway_aipswu_0. The marker_278 is also on the driveway_aipswu_0. The car_275 is also on the driveway_aipswu_0 but it is not relevant to our task. The first step would be to move the robot to the driveway_aipswu_0 where the suitcase_276, colored_pencil_277, and marker_278 are located.",

        "explain": " The error occurred because the robot tried to move to a location (\"location_4\") that does not exist in the environment. The original plan was to explore the environment by moving the robot to different locations until the vehicle is observed. However, this plan is problematic because it assumes that the vehicle is a large object placed directly on the ground, which may not be the case. Also, it assumes that the environment has specific locations (\"location_1\", \"location_4\") where the vehicle can be observed, which is also not necessarily true. Therefore, a new plan is needed.",

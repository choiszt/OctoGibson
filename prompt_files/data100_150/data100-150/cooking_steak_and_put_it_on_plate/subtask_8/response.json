        "explain": " The error message indicates that the steak cannot be cooked because it is not heatable. This is because the steak is not on a heatable object, such as a stove or a frying pan. The steak is currently on the frying pan, but the frying pan is not on the stove, which is why the steak is not heatable. Therefore, the frying pan with the steak needs to be placed on the stove before the steak can be cooked.",

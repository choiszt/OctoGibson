        "explain": " The error message \"Found zero norm quaternions in `quat`\" indicates that there was an issue with the quaternion used for the robot's orientation during movement. This could be due to the robot trying to move to an object that is not directly placed on the ground, such as the chard. According to the action list, the MoveBot function can only move the robot to a position in front of large objects that are placed directly on the ground. Therefore, the robot cannot directly move to the chard.",

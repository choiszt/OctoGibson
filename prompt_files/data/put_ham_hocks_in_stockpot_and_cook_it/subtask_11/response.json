However, the original subtask plan is incorrect because the oven cannot cook the ham hocks directly. The ham hocks should be cooked inside the stockpot, and the stockpot should be heated by the oven. Therefore, the correct action should be to heat the stockpot, which contains the ham hocks, in the oven.",

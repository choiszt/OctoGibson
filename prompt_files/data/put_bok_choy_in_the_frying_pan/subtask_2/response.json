        "explain": " The error occurred because the robot was instructed to move to the \"kitchen_area\", which is not an object in the environment. The robot can only move to a position in front of large objects (e.g., tables, ovens, etc.) that are placed directly on the ground. The robot cannot directly move to small objects (e.g., apples, plates, etc.). Therefore, we need to revise the subtask and move the robot to a specific object in the kitchen, such as the oven.",

        "explain": " Since the task goal is to cook bacon and there is no previous action code or execution errors, I will start by planning the subtasks. Currently, the observed objects include a fridge, griddle, stove, tray, and bacon. Notably, the fridge is in a closed state and contains a tray which in turn holds the bacon (['bacon_150', 'inside', 'fray_156'], ['tray_156', 'inside', 'fridge_xyejdx_0']). Therefore, my first task will be to open the fridge to access the tray with the bacon.",

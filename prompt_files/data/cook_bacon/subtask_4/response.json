        "explain": " The robot failed in the execution because it tried to pick up the bacon without the check, but the bacon is inside a tray. The robot automatically picked up everything in the same reachability area if not specifically articulated, which is causing \"robot carries more than 1 object!\". Therefore, the robot picked up both the bacon and the tray. We need to revise the original subtasks, putting the bacon on the tray is not necessary as it's already there. We should proceed to the next subtask which is cooking the bacon.",

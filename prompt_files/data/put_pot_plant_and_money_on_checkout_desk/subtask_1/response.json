From the observed objects and relations, we can see that the pot plant (pot_plant_152) is far away from the robot (15.83m), and the money (money_145, money_146, money_147) is already on the checkout desk (checkout_counter_sckdal_0). Therefore, the first subtask should be to move the robot to the pot plant.",

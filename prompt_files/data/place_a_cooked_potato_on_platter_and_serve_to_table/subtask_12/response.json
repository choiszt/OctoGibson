This could be due to an incorrect assumption about the state of the environment or the inventory. In this case, it seems that the original subtasks are not in line with the observed objects and relations. The potato is not in the fridge but on the bottom cabinet. Also, the platter is already on the breakfast table, not in the bottom cabinet. Therefore, the subtasks need to be revised.",

The next step in the original subtasks is to put the carrot into the saucepot. However, the observed relations show that the saucepot is currently under the stove, which means the robot cannot directly put the carrot into the saucepot. Therefore, the robot needs to first move the saucepot from under the stove before it can put the carrot into the saucepot.",

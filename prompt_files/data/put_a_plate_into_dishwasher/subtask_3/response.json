This could be due to the robot trying to move to an invalid location or a location that it cannot reach. In this case, the robot is trying to move to the dishwasher, which is 8.23 meters away, but the robot can only interact with objects within two meters. Therefore, the robot needs to move closer to the dishwasher.",

From the observed objects, we can see that there are two suitcases (suitcase_285 and suitcase_286) and a car (car_275) in the environment. We can assume that the suitcases are the bags we need to put into the car. However, we don't know which suitcase is closer to the car, so we need to move the robot to the car first to observe the environment again.",

From the observed objects and relations, we can see that the box of chocolates is on the countertop, and the paper bag (which we can assume is the sack) is also on the countertop. The first step would be to move the robot to the countertop, then grasp the box of chocolates, and finally put the box of chocolates in the sack.",

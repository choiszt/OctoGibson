From the observed objects, we can see that the cheese_tart_188 is inside the fridge_dszchb_0 and it is freezable. We can assume that the cheese_tart_188 is the pie we need to heat. The fridge and the oven are more than 2 meters away from the robot, so we need to move the robot closer to interact with them.",

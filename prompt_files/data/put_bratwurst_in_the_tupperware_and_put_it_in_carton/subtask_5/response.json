This is because the tupperware is not visible in the environment and has not been registered yet. The original subtask plan is incorrect because it assumes that the tupperware is visible after opening the bottom cabinet, but the tupperware might be inside the cabinet. Therefore, we need to revise the subtask plan to first open the bottom cabinet and then grasp the tupperware.",

    Demo of ParticleSource and ParticleSink object states, which enable objects to either spawn arbitrary
    particles and remove arbitrary particles from the simulator, respectively.

    Loads an empty scene with a sink, which is enabled with both the ParticleSource and ParticleSink states.
    The sink's particle source is located at the faucet spout and spawns a continuous stream of water particles,
    which is then destroyed ("sunk") by the sink's particle sink located at the drain.

    NOTE: The key difference between ParticleApplier/Removers and ParticleSource/Sinks is that Applier/Removers
    requires contact (if using ParticleProjectionMethod.ADJACENCY) or overlap
    (if using ParticleProjectionMethod.PROJECTION) in order to spawn / remove particles, and generally only spawn
    particles at the contact points. ParticleSource/Sinks are special cases of ParticleApplier/Removers that
    always use ParticleProjectionMethod.PROJECTION and always spawn / remove particles within their projection volume,
    irregardless of overlap with other objects!
